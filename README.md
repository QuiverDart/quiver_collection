## Documentation

[API Docs](http://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/quiver_collection/latest)

`listsEqual`, `mapsEqual` and `setsEqual` check collections for equality.

`LruMap` is a map that removes the least recently used item when a threshold
length is exceeded.

`Multimap` is an associative collection that maps keys to collections of
values.

`BiMap` is a bidirectional map and provides an inverse view, allowing
lookup of key by value.

`TreeSet` is a balanced binary tree that offers a bidirectional iterator,
the ability to iterate from an arbitrary anchor, and 'nearest' search.
